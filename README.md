# Water Usage in Australia - Data Visualization

An interactive data visualization project exploring water usage patterns in Australia from 2014 to 2022. This project presents multiple visualizations analyzing water consumption across different industries, states, and territories, as well as comparisons with global water usage.

## Visualizations

1. **Water Stations Distribution**: Cluster visualization showing approximately 7,700 water stations across Australia
2. **Water Distribution by Industry**: Bar chart showing water use by industries and households (2014-2022)
3. **Agricultural Water Usage**: Detailed breakdown of water usage on farms by crop type and state
4. **Water Extraction & Usage**: Comparison of water sourced and used on farms across Australian states
5. **Per Capita Water Consumption**: Choropleth map showing water efficiency across states and territories
6. **Water Use & Supply**: Analysis of water use and supply patterns within Australia
7. **Global Comparison**: World map visualization comparing Australia's water withdrawal with other countries
