            <h2>Where is all the water stored?</h2>
            <p>This can be investigated by visualising all the water stations within Australia, but more importantly the <span class="text">clusters of water stations</span> that are present in each state.</p>
            <p>We currently have approximately <span class="text">7700 water stations</span>, with most of it located on the South-East side of Australia. </p>
            <p>This is in fact expected, as having multiple water stations closer to the edge of the continent located with a higher population density will allow water to be more easily accessible.</p>

            <h2>How has water been distributed throughout the years?</h2>
            <p>The increased use of distributed water for agriculture in 2021-22 was driven by <span class="text">good seasonal weather outlooks</span>, which encouraged farmers to ramp up production of water-intensive crops, specifically cotton and rice production. </p>
            <p>- New South Wales used 44% of all distributed water used by Agriculture, forestry and fishing</p>
            <p>- New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland combined accounted for 91% of all distributed water used by Agriculture, forestry and fishing.</p>

            <h2>Water Usage Breakdown on Farms</h2>
            <p>It appears that a majority of how the water is used on farms is on <span class="text">"Cereals for grain or seed, excluding rice"</span> for Australia overall. However within Queensland, a lot more water is distributed to "Sugar cane" instead.</p>
            <p>This can also be seen in Tasmania and Northern Territory where they concentrate on other goods such as <span class="text">fruit, vegetables and nuts instead of grain or seed.</span></p>

            <h2>Are we using water efficiently across different states and territories?</h2>
            <p>However, are we using a considerable amount of water on farms in comparison to the amount we extract?</p>
            <p>From a quick glance, we can see that Tasmania has the highest water consumption per capita, followed by New South Wales and Queensland</p>
            <p>This is quite interesting, as these states have varying levels of industrial and agricultural activities, which significantly influence their water usage patterns. Tasmania, for instance, has <span class="text">high industry water consumption</span>, contributing to its elevated per capita usage</span></p>

          <h2>Supply</h2>
          <p>The amount of water supply within Australia can mainly be attributed to Tasmania from their electricity, gas, water, and waste services.</p> 
          <p>This is quite surprising considering the land size of Tasmania in compairson to the other states within Australia, however this could also be due to the fact that most of the states were not recording values as much or accurately as Tasmania was. </p>
          <p>This can be seen to the null and empty values that were present in the initial dataset.</p>

  <h2>How does Australia compare to the World?</h2>
  <h3>Water Withdrawal (measured in km^3)</h3>
  <div id="vis8"  class="vis-container"></div>
  <p>The amount of <span class="text">water withdrawal varies significantly</span> across the world. The visualisation above shows the <span class="text">average level of water withdrawal</span> during the latest recorded year (2017). As defined in the AQUASTAT Database, water withdrawal</span>
    is defined as the quantity of freshwater taken from groundwater or surface water sources (i.e., lakes or rivers) for use in services (houses or domestic), agricultural and industrial.
  </p>
  <p>As shown, India has withdrawn the most water withi nthe year 2017 by a considerable amount. In terms of where Australia lies at, the <span class="text">amount of water we have extracted is greater than 50%</span> of the other countries. 
    However, one of the reasons of why we are not extracting as much water as the other countries such as USA, China or India, is due to the lack of fully utilising the entire land of Australia, in other words, the population density of Australia is greatly less than those of China.

  <h3>Freshwater efficiency use for households and public services</h3>
  <div id="vis9"  class="vis-container"></div>
  <p>Water used for home, household, or public functions is referred to as <span class="text">municipal water</span>. This is the most 'visible' type of water: the water we drink, clean with, wash with, and cook with.</p>
  <p>Germany's domestic water consumption are the highest, at about 500US$/m^3, which is surprising due to the total amount of water they withdraw. In terms of India, with the world's largest water withdrawal, 
    does not utilise their water resources within services as much. Despite having a far smaller population, <span class="text">Australia uses a substantial amount</span> with around 200US$/m^3</p>
